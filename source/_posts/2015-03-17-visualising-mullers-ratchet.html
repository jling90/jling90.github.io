Data visualisations are a fantastic medium for communicating knowledge.
They are often intuitive and information-dense.
Recently I've been experimenting with the data visualisation library
d3.js. There are a wealth of fantastic example's on d3's website.

<p style="text-align:justify text-justify:inter-word">
As a thematic continuation from the previous posts, I've attempted a
number of illustrations in d3 related to Muller's ratchet.

<div id="svgarea"></div>

<script src="javascripts/libs/d3/d3.min.js"></script>
<script src="javascripts/muller_grid.js"></script>

<p style="text-align:justify text-justify:inter-word">
Initially, the grid above represents a population of
mutation-free individuals. Mutations are applied to the population
over time, sampling from a Poisson distribution. As the number of
mutations increases, squares become progressively more red.

</p>

<p style="text-align:justify text-justify:inter-word">
We can intuit that as population size increases, it will take longer
for the population to become 'fully' mutated, and conversely for
increasing mutation rate.
Try playing with the parameters to see if this reflects expectation.
