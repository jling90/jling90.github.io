Hi and welcome to my blog. My name is Jun.

By day, I'm a student at the University of Queensland studying a 
Bachelor of Software Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Genetics
(masked villain by night). I have a keen interest in programming, science 
and especially where the two intersect.

I spend a lot of my time in a linux terminal hacking together little
scripts to automate manual tasks in the blind hope that I'll be saving
effort in the long run.
At leisure I'm also an avid reader. I'll consume anything I can get my
hands on; science papers, tech blogs or fiction novels. I think
there's as much to learn from Kurt Vonnegut as Russel &amp; Norvig.

I hope you'll take the time to poke through some of my stuff and 
ask uncomfortable questions about things I've gotten wrong or worded
poorly. That seems to me the best way to learn.

-Jun
