Password logins are something we should all be familiar with from day-to-day life.
One topic that frequently comes up is: "how do we select our passwords?" One obvious
but important point to make is that a *strong password is one which a computer will
have difficulty guessing, not a human*. What follows is a (hopefully) intuitive
introduction to password security to those without an information security background.

Many services require that passwords contain some combination of lower case and upper case
letters, numbers and symbols. A minimum password length is also often enforced. 

Shannon entropy (not to be confused with thermodynamic entropy, a similarly harrowing
concept), 

The obvious challenge is that passwords often end up being meaningless strings of
characters which are difficult to remember.

Using 'pass phrases' in the place of passwords allow the generation of memorable
passwords which are higher in entropy than short strings of characters.

One idea I find particularly clever idea which extends the principle of pass phrases is 
called Diceware.
